# Multi-competition platform — roadmap

**Status date:** 5 August 2026  
**Purpose:** current delivery position and next executable slice.  
**Current facts:** [`quality/current-status.md`](quality/current-status.md)  
**Parent programme:** [`architecture/programme-plan.md`](architecture/programme-plan.md)  
**Engineering workstream:** [`architecture/multi-competition-hub-build-plan.md`](architecture/multi-competition-hub-build-plan.md)  
**Detailed inventory:** [`../MASTER-TODO.md`](../MASTER-TODO.md)  
**Decision authority:** [`adr/README.md`](adr/README.md)

This roadmap does **not** duplicate the programme phases or Stage A–L engineering plan. It records where delivery is now and the next executable sequence.

> **What the finished product should look like:** [`design/README.md`](design/README.md) — the target design authority (Hub Architecture and Modernisation Plan rev 1.5, plus the landing-page prototype). It sets presentation and delivery; it changes no rule.

## Current baseline

Every moving value — the current `main` commit, the repository contract, each hosted contract, the live production deploy — is stated in [`quality/current-status.md`](quality/current-status.md) and [`ops/ops-pending-migrations.md`](ops/ops-pending-migrations.md). **This document deliberately states none of them.**

It used to. The result was a baseline nine releases behind the repository, sitting beside a pinned deploy id and short commit — one line below a bullet warning that a pinned SHA in a live document goes stale. Naming an authority and then restating its facts produces two answers to one question, and the stale one is the one that gets read. `tests/scripts/documentationContractFreshness.test.ts` now fails if any of it comes back.

What is durable enough to state here:

- Euro 2028: recoverable at `euro-2028-baseline`, with remaining tournament work parked until January 2028;
- production Netlify deploys are paused by the prebuild contract gate until an intentional production migration/release milestone. The last good deploy stays live;
- Stage B: complete through PR #226, with the retained checklist closed by PR #239;
- Stage C: design baseline, assertion classification, C2 non-interference and the detailed C1 schema overlay are complete. The Stage C1 migration is merged (PRs #317, #349) with hosted rollout tooling and a guarded GitHub workflow (PRs #350, #351); the hosted development apply **completed and was postflight-verified 2–3 August 2026** (PRs #359–#368 hardened the tooling en route). No production write is authorised;
- lock policy is **game-owned** (ADR 0020, PR #353): the competition supplies identity, calendar and structure; each game supplies its own explicit lock policy, failing closed when missing or incompatible.

## Development operating model

[`adr/0024-development-environment-operating-model.md`](adr/0024-development-environment-operating-model.md) is the authority for how work reaches the development environment. It exists because the ceremony protecting production had been applied to a database with no data worth protecting, and the cost was paid on every schema change.

- development data is **disposable** until a closed external cohort holds it. That expiry is a *condition*, not a date: the model ends when real entrants exist, whoever notices first;
- an **additive** development migration applies through `.github/workflows/development-fast-lane-rollout.yml`, which proves additiveness by reading the pending migrations rather than trusting the dispatcher. Anything destructive is refused and sent back to `stage-c1-development-rollout.yml`, which keeps the backup and restore rehearsal;
- a deploy preview whose hosted database trails the repository contract now **builds and reports the gap** instead of failing. Production keeps the fatal check. This ended a circular gate in which a schema-advancing PR could not produce a green preview before the merge that would make its schema real;
- browser journeys are **selected from the change** (`scripts/select-browser-journeys.mjs`), widening to the full suite on anything unrecognised. Contract and schema changes always run everything;
- development data is **reseedable** through `npm run reset:development`, which refuses both hosted project refs.

**What ADR 0024 does not relax:** production backup, preflight, approval and verification; RLS; TypeScript/PostgreSQL parity; and the C2 block under issue #272. Production has no fast lane.

## Delivered foundation

### Stage A — authority and control alignment

The platform ADRs, parent/child planning hierarchy, state architecture and domain controls are established. Brand selection is deferred with a trigger under ADR 0019 and is not on the engineering critical path.

### Stage B — competition-context foundation and surface migration

Complete on `main`:

- pure context, lock and match-state foundation through PR #212;
- Home migration through PR #219;
- Matches, Match Centre, entry lock and `MatchTemporalState` retirement through PR #226;
- clean application, database, preview and authenticated-browser gates before integration;
- retained inventory closure through PR #239.

### Landed control and Stage C preparation

- PR #228: cross-tournament read scoping, production guard derivation, real 404 routing and deployment-contract controls.
- PR #229: Original Predictor scoring parity.
- PR #232: complete Database parity directory execution.
- PR #233: CSP/application resource parity.
- PR #235: environment and deployment-RPC/database-privilege parity.
- PR #245: timezone-authority before-state.
- PR #246: effective account-deletion action before-state.
- PR #250: exhaustive public-table RLS and security-definer `search_path` guard.
- PR #252: `competitionTimeZone`/`viewerTimeZone` seam with temporary viewer fallback.
- PR #255: TypeScript test project and corrected timezone fixtures.
- PR #258: Playwright/e2e, TypeScript tool and config coverage.
- PR #261: production-smoke coverage, explicit strictness and exhaustive committed TS/TSX project guard.
- PR #264: typechecking for the three JavaScript deploy gates and an explicit deferred JavaScript inventory.
- PR #265: exhaustive public-view and direct browser relation-grant guard.
- PR #266: disposable-local leaderboard scale evidence; ACQ-R02 remains open and no standings migration was introduced.
- Original Stage C TypeScript contracts: `stageCRelationCoverage`, `stageCFunctionCoverage`, `stageCTriggerBindingCoverage`, `stageCTournamentIdCompatibility` and `stageCEuroSeedPreservation`.
- Hostile reference before-state: `031_stage_c_reference_scope_before_state.sql` (PR #286).
- Lock and late-write before-state: `032_stage_c_lock_before_state.sql` (PR #292).
- C1 boundary: `stageC1ContractClassification.test.ts` enforces the 40/0/9 assertion split; `stageC1NonInterference` freezes auth ownership, deletion FKs and ownership RLS.
- C1 overlay: `stageC1SchemaOverlayCoverage.test.ts` proves every original relation and reviewed function has a current C1/C2/shared disposition.
- C1 lock-function consistency: `stageC1LockFunctionConsistency.test.ts` compares the entry-lock trigger definitions to each other. The migration defines each twice because the season-scope backfill writes to lock-guarded tables, and the second definition of the generic guard had drifted to `security definer` + `session_user` — which left the trusted automatic-submission refresh permanently unreachable. `pg_proc` cannot see this, because the live database only shows the last definition.
- PRs #319–#340 (31 July 2026): gate integrity and accessibility enforcement. CI refuses to pass a suite that discovered no test files; the browser-suite path filter now watches what its jobs read, including the deployment contract; the deploy smoke compares served security headers against the committed ones rather than checking four of thirteen directives; every `e2e` spec is proven to run under exactly one Playwright config with a project gate that exists. Accessibility moved from a scan over 11 of 34 routes to every declared route plus the component gallery, component states no route renders, the design-token contrast matrix and the declared CSS pairings — with axe's `incomplete` results counted, not discarded. Thirteen real defects were found and fixed, and the palette was raised so every text pairing meets AA (`--gold-strong` added; the light muted ramp rebalanced). Two accessibility deferrals remain, both "covered elsewhere" rather than gaps.

PRs #245 and #246 remain before-state contracts. PR #252 is the application seam. PRs #250, #255, #258, #261, #264 and #265 are preservation invariants.

## Stage C design and governance

PR #236 — **merged 30 July 2026** — remains the original combined design record.

The accepted implementation authority is now:

- [`architecture/stage-c1-c2-governance.md`](architecture/stage-c1-c2-governance.md) — C1/C2 split;
- [`architecture/stage-c1-contract-classification.md`](architecture/stage-c1-contract-classification.md) — 40 C1, zero authorised C2 after-state and nine shared-before-state assertions;
- [`architecture/stage-c1-schema-overlay.md`](architecture/stage-c1-schema-overlay.md) — relation, function, RLS, migration-order and evidence dispositions for C1.

Stage C1 keeps current auth-owned competitive rows unchanged and is tracked by issue #303. Stage C2 remains blocked by the independent data-protection review in issue #272.

None of these documents authorises a migration or hosted write.

## Delivered platform backend since Stage C

The repository has moved well beyond the original Stage C foundation. The moving contract and hosted values remain in [`quality/current-status.md`](quality/current-status.md) and [`ops/ops-pending-migrations.md`](ops/ops-pending-migrations.md); the durable delivered capabilities are:

- the competition-season catalogue, separate game memberships and game-owned lock policies;
- season fixtures, Match Predictor cards, Jokers, lock resolution, recurring submission scheduling, scoring, replay-safe fixture reassignment, stored matchweek totals and bounded standings;
- season LMS eligibility, deterministic auto-assignment, used-team cycles, selection writes, correction-aware settlement and entrant-state replay;
- competition-neutral Championship/Cup points and settlement sources, season scheduling rules, persisted split phases, one-parent ancestry and a continuing table derived from settled initial and split fixtures;
- provider-response custody with strict decoding, archive-before-processing evidence and no path from a provider response to official result truth;
- repeatable competition instances, explicit live/current instance resolution and correction-safe terminal rederivation.

These are backend and control foundations. They do not mean that the season game surfaces, split driver, restart lifecycle, provider rehearsal or closed-cohort product have been delivered.

## Next executable sequence

1. **Finish the LMS restart lifecycle governed by ADR 0025.** A public `restart_all_reentered` wipeout creates a new linked competition row, copies immutable setup only, re-enters the previous field with no picks or used-team state, starts at the next eligible round and records one idempotent audited lifecycle event. Settlement continues to report the outcome rather than creating the successor itself.
2. **Run the first bounded provider rehearsal in non-production.** Configure only the approved development credential/path, make one request, prove raw custody precedes decode, prove processing evidence is append-only and prove no official fixture, result, lock, score, total, rank or standing is written. If credentials or provider authority are unavailable, stop rather than weakening the boundary.
3. **Build the season game surfaces from the accepted design authority.** Sequence the phone-first Match Predictor completion flow and retention standings; the LMS weekly-picks/read model and private-management paths; the Predictor Championship phase driver, tables and fixtures; then the Hub action/social shell. Backend availability is not a substitute for a usable surface.
4. **Instrument before cohort exposure.** Emit the Phase 1 taxonomy from the first surface commit, then run the headless season/anomaly log and only introduce a closed cohort after the provisional path is stable.
5. **Keep production paused as a separate milestone.** Repository and development progress do not authorise production migration or publication. Production promotion retains backup, preflight, approval, exact-artifact verification and rollback evidence.
6. **Keep Stage C2 blocked.** No ownership, erasure, pseudonymisation or replacement ownership-RLS work enters the platform until issue #272 records the independent data-protection decision.
7. **Review ACQ-R02 only at its trigger.** Reopen maintained standings only on a material cap increase or adverse rehearsal/hosted concurrency evidence, not merely because the design exists.

## Parked Euro 2028 scope

The complete inventory remains in [`../MASTER-TODO.md`](../MASTER-TODO.md) for January 2028. It includes official data, final tournament presentation, administration fit-for-final verification, rehearsal, operational recovery and the published-release decision.
