# Design authority — start here

**The latest design document is
[`hub-architecture-and-modernisation-plan.md`](hub-architecture-and-modernisation-plan.md)
(revision 1.5, 4 August 2026).** It is the answer to "what should this look like
when it is done".

This folder exists because that question previously had no single answer. Design
intent was spread across `docs/design-system.md` (component-level, Euro-era),
ADR 0020, ADR 0021 and ADR 0023 (product model, sharing, information
architecture), with no document describing the finished product. Anyone asking
"what are we building towards" had to assemble it.

| Document | What it decides | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`hub-architecture-and-modernisation-plan.md`](hub-architecture-and-modernisation-plan.md) | Target architecture, information architecture, page/journey design, the complete UI state model, feedback hierarchy, rollout method, and — in Appendix E — the public acquisition landing page and standalone Euro 2028 boundary | **Current target design (rev 1.5)** |
| [`hub-landing-prototype.html`](hub-landing-prototype.html) | The executable form of Appendix E: the public landing page and an accurate signed-in Hub preview | **Current prototype**, conforms to E.3/E.4/E.7 |
| [`../design-system.md`](../design-system.md) | Component-level rules built for the Euro tournament: score input, match card, group tables, bracket, navigation | **In force for what exists**; superseded on presentation by the plan where the two describe the same surface |

## What this authority does and does not do

It is a **presentation and delivery** authority. Its own Document Control section
says so: *"Accepted ADRs, later amendments, migrations, executable tests and
explicit rule authorities govern implementation … This plan may organise delivery
and presentation, but must not silently change those rules."*

So it may not change scoring, locks, memberships, settlement, progression or
visibility rules. Those remain with the ADRs, the migrations and the executable
tests. Where the plan restates a rule (Appendix D.1), it is *recording* the
repository's rule, not creating one — and if the restatement and the code
disagree, the code and its tests win, and the disagreement is a defect in the
document.

## Read the baseline before you act on it

**The plan reviewed a snapshot of 93 migrations and 69 pgTAP suites** (§2.1).
`main` is at **97 migrations / 73 pgTAP suites** — contracts 94–97 landed on
4 August 2026, after the snapshot was taken:

| contract | what landed |
| --- | --- |
| 94 | `standings.ts` SQL parity — the season table, ranked |
| 95 | the bounded season leaderboard read, limited to league co-members |
| 96 | Cup tie refusal-order parity fix, found by differential sweep |
| 97 | server-only provider-response custody |

Nothing in those contradicts the plan, but **Appendix D.2's reconciliation list
predates them** and must be checked against
[`../quality/current-status.md`](../quality/current-status.md) before being
treated as outstanding work. One item needs care in particular:

> D.2 lists *"post-lock reveal — existing rival/profile RPCs still contain
> shared-league gates"* as drift to remove.

Contract 95 deliberately **applied** a co-member gate to the season leaderboard.
These are most likely compatible — D.2 concerns **Euro post-lock profile and
entry reveal**, contract 95 concerns **season standings**, and the platform
boundary explicitly limits other players' data to league co-members — but the two
should not be reconciled by assumption. Confirm the scope before changing either.

## The prototype's one repository-side change

The supplied prototype inherited its semantic colours (`--success`, `--warning`,
`--live`, `--danger`) into light mode from the dark ramp. On the light surfaces
they rendered at **1.3–2.2:1**, so the tick marks, rank deltas, "Predictions
saved" state and the authentication error all failed WCAG AA.

The repository copy restates them for light mode, solved against `#e7ebef` — the
**darkest** light surface, which is the worst case for a dark foreground — and
`--danger` additionally against the 10% tint it composes for `.auth-error`, which
is darker still. Hues are preserved to within one degree.

| token | dark (unchanged) | light (was inherited) | light now | worst case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `--success` | `#54d49a` | 1.56:1 | `#16794c` | 4.53:1 |
| `--warning` | `#f2c75c` | 1.34:1 | `#8a6301` | 4.53:1 |
| `--live` | `#ff7357` | 2.24:1 | `#cf2200` | 4.52:1 |
| `--danger` | `#ff7d95` | 2.03:1 | `#c70025` | 5.07:1 |

This is the same defect class the repository already guards against for
`--mut` (PR #344, "never a foreground"), and Appendix E.4 keeps theme switching a
functional requirement of the prototype — so it is a conformance fix, not a
redesign. `tests/design/landingPrototypeContract.test.ts` now holds it, along
with the E.3 section order, the E.4 token discipline and the E.7 acceptance
checklist.
