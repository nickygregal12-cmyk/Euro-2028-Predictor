/**
 * The deterministic development/E2E seed contract.
 *
 * Authority: ADR 0024, which requires development to be deterministically
 * reseedable — seed users, game memberships, rehearsal fixtures, admin and
 * ordinary-player accounts, and a one-command reset.
 *
 * Why this file exists rather than identities living inline in
 * `global-setup.ts`: contract 66 moved the membership authority, and the
 * browser fixtures did not move with it. Every authenticated surface then
 * rendered empty and 33 specs failed for one cause. Seeds have to travel
 * with the schema, and that only happens if there is one declared place
 * where "what a seeded user needs" is written down, plus a guard that fails
 * when the schema moves past the last time anyone checked.
 *
 * `SEED_REVIEWED_AT_CONTRACT` is that guard. Raise it only after actually
 * re-verifying that a seeded user is functional on the new contract — never
 * to make a red test green.
 */

/**
 * The database contract at which these requirements were last verified.
 *
 * Raised to 67 after checking what contract 67 actually changes: it moves
 * `game_definitions.lock_scope` for `main_predictor` and `last_man_standing`
 * from 'round' to 'matchweek'. That column is only ever *emitted* — passed
 * outward in the `lock_policy` payload of `get_competition_games` — and no SQL
 * function branches on it (the gating branches on `requires_prediction_entry`),
 * nor does any browser code read it. It therefore cannot gate an authenticated
 * read, which is the failure this number exists to catch.
 *
 * Contract 68 adds `season_fixtures`, revoked from every browser role and
 * created empty, plus two composite unique constraints on `teams` and
 * `competition_rounds` that add a key rather than restricting an existing one.
 * Nothing a seeded Euro user reads changes.
 *
 * Contract 69 adds `season_predictions` and `season_matchweek_jokers`, both
 * revoked from every browser role and created empty, plus composite unique
 * keys on `entries` and `season_fixtures` that add a key rather than
 * restricting an existing one. Its triggers fire only on the two new tables,
 * so no path a seeded Euro user takes is affected.
 *
 * Contract 70 adds two `predictor_internal` scoring functions, both revoked
 * from every browser role. It creates no table, no trigger and no policy, and
 * changes no existing relation, so nothing a seeded user reads is gated by it.
 *
 * Contract 71 adds one further `predictor_internal` LMS survival-resolution
 * function on the same terms: immutable, revoked from every browser role and
 * touching no relation.
 *
 * Contract 72 adds private append-only provider custody in the unexposed
 * `predictor_internal` schema plus two service-role-only append RPCs. It adds
 * no browser grant, policy, seeded row or authoritative provider write path.
 * The exact-head browser suite re-verifies the existing seeded Euro journeys.
