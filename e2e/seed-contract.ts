/**
 * The deterministic development/E2E seed contract.
 *
 * Authority: ADR 0024, which requires development to be deterministically
 * reseedable — seed users, game memberships, rehearsal fixtures, admin and
 * ordinary-player accounts, and a one-command reset.
 *
 * Why this file exists rather than identities living inline in
 * `global-setup.ts`: contract 66 moved the membership authority, and the
 * browser fixtures did not move with it. Every authenticated surface then
 * rendered empty and 33 specs failed for one cause. Seeds have to travel
 * with the schema, and that only happens if there is one declared place
 * where "what a seeded user needs" is written down, plus a guard that fails
 * when the schema moves past the last time anyone checked.
 *
 * `SEED_REVIEWED_AT_CONTRACT` is that guard. Raise it only after actually
 * re-verifying that a seeded user is functional on the new contract — never
 * to make a red test green.
 */

/**
 * The database contract at which these requirements were last verified.
 *
 * The detailed historical contract-by-contract seed review through Contract
 * 189 remains preserved in Git history. Contract 190 is the AI Lab actionable
 * betting-evidence hardening only: it redefines `ai.reject_unbettable_price`,
 * `ai.valid_bets`, and the competition-admin-gated
 * `public.admin_ai_bet_builder_candidates`. The deterministic seed writes no
 * `ai` relation, the administrator still carries the same `competitions`
 * capability, and no entry, membership, prediction-card or player-facing read
 * is changed. Exact-head Database parity run 31781402733 and Browser E2E run
 * 31781402730 both passed on the Contract-190 pull request before this marker
 * was raised, re-verifying the seeded authenticated journeys rather than merely
 * reasoning about them.
